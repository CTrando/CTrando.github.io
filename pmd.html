    <p>Hello! Thanks for being curious enough about my project to click on this! I'll try to be quick about this and use
        lots of gifs to help me out!</p>
    <br>
    <div class="vid-list">
        <p>So I will go through my list of features here.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In the game, everything is of course animated. I streamlined the animation process to allow for new
                animations, although I am a terrible artist so I used the original game sprites. Below I demonstrate the
                animated movement system.

            <li>
                And of course with a movement system, the next thing I wanted to implemented was an attack system.
                Players can attack enemies, and vice-versa.
            </li>

            <li>
                Items have been implemented into the game. Red berries give health and turns (as the game is
                turn-based), apples give health, and blue orbs teleport!
            </li>

            <li>
                As in the original Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games, the player can take stairs to advance to the next
                floor. At the moment, there is no real point to taking the stairs besides seeing some new terrain, but
                maybe one day in the future I will implement dungeons with bosses after a certain number of floors.
            </li>

            <li>
                Next, I implemented tile-based traps. This was in the original Mystery Dungeon games; however, I would
                like to think I improved the animations and made them more than just a little annoying.

                One of the more interesting feature I implemented was pathfinding. This was part of an attempt to create
                a more intelligence AI for the enemies. However, that process got bogged down by all the other parts of
                the games
                such as aesthetics and mechanics. Despite those setbacks, I was at least able to implement pathfinding
                through both Depth-First and Breadth-First search.

                Now it comes down to my last notable feature: Random and Procedural Dungeon Generation. This is where
                each floor is completely <strong>random yet has similar attributes, such as rooms and stairs</strong>. I
                would argue that it's
                comparable to random terrain generation. One could create just a random compilation of rooms, but the
                trick is that the player <strong>must be able to reach each and every tile from each and every other
                tile</strong>.
                This feature is <strong>hard</strong> to do, even for my skills right now. It took me one month to do it
                the first time, and a week to do it the second time. But now, it has a 100% success rate and it is one
                of the only part of
                the game that is completely bug-free. Source code can be found <a
