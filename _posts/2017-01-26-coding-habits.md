title: Rambling on Coding Habits
---

It's been a little while since I've put any posts on this website, and that's mainly because they are sort of a pain to make. I feel bad if they are below a certain word count, but I guess that is just some fragments of my writer side. 

Anyway, I'm going to dedicate this post to talk about some of my coding habits. 

I am an extremely messy programmer. As in, to me, my code is slop. So that's why if it takes me a month to produce something, it actually takes me a week to produce it, and two more to fix it up. That's what I was doing from September to December. I bought books such as Head First Design Patterns and Code Complete 2 in order to learn some better ways to solve problems. As a result of those books, I started changing the way I wrote everything and fixing everything I had previously written, and that takes a long time. Basically I started out with procedural dungeon generation, animation, tile movement and attacks, and I ended up with the same thing. 

I'm still changing my codebase even now. The other day, I consolidated three or four classes into one (keeping in mind to separate my methods and make sure that everything was clean). However now, because of all those edits I made a few months ago, I can more easily extend my codebase and add new features. Adding a system to skin tiles based on their relative locations to each other only took me 15 minutes. I was able to add an on screen controller for androids easily. But still, the habit of going back is somewhat annoying, as anytime I get an idea to do something better, I end up stalling my progress to go back and fix stuff. It's for the best, but it's a little frustrating sometimes. 

Habit #1 : Always rewrite previous code!

Back to my coding habits though. I like to wander a lot. Which means I'll work on one feature today and another tomorrow. That means a lot of my stuff does not end up getting completed. Of course, I'll go back eventually, but it will take me quite a while. That might be the case for this website, but let's see how it goes. But as a result of my wandering, I have lots of time to come up with ideas on how to solve my problems. Which is why another tenet of mine is to just get some sleep if I cannot figure out to solve a problem. For example, currently, I'm trying to add in a system where I can type when focused on my game (focused as in my mouse is clicked on it). So in order to do that, I'll need to hit a key to make my game enter a certain mode where when I type a key, instead of translating into a game action, it will translate into a text action.

I already have a system for displaying text (that's what I worked on today), so all I need is a way to do what I previously stated efficiently. Of course, there is the way of brute forcing the code, but I really try not to do that. One, I know it will hurt me in the end, and two, there's got to be a better way. So what I'm hoping for is that something will come to me while I'm doing something else. 

Habit #2 : Take lots of breaks!

I have a mechanical keyboard, I type around 120 words per minute, and I love the sound my keyboard makes, so my third habit would be....

Habit #3 : Make loud noises with my keyboard!

That's more personal than anything else; I just find it really easy to keep writing when I have a long keyboard chain to keep me going. As I said before, I tend to wander, and that's exactly what I'm going to do now. I'll update this later. See ya!
