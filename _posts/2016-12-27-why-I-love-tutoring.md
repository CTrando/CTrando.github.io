title: Why I Love Tutoring
---

Most times I tutor, I get angry. No, I don’t angry with my students (I have tremendous respect for their efforts at self-improvement), I get angry with the system that’s ‘teaching’ them. 

My job as a Peer Tutor is to help students reinforce what they’ve learned in class, but too many times, what they’ve learned in class is nothing. Sometimes the class goes too fast, sometimes the class is too confusing, but once again, too many times, it comes down to ‘this is how it is, memorize it’. So I get angry.
    
I get angry when a bright sophomore with a low Math grade comes to me asking for help, and understands everything perfectly, but still can’t improve his grade. I get angry after seeing him gradually change to an enthusiastic learner to a sullen memorizer. 
    
I get angry when two freshman come in asking for Physics help, nod along with everything I say, but when I ask them if they understand, the answer is no. I get angry that it’s become a reaction, an instinct, for them to just nod and stay silent: that is how they survive their classes. 
    
And this anger, it comes because I just care so much. As someone who loves learning, it just pains me to see these intelligent students sacrifice passion for grades, curiosity for grades, their potential for grades. So tutoring is extremely important to me, as I see it as a way to restore that love of learning to others, to show them that there is more than one answer, that their teachers can be wrong, that this is why it works, so learn it. Tutoring is one of the activities I enjoy the most, because although I believe in bad systems, I don’t believe in bad students.
